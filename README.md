*Thanks for the amazing picture of Zinku to artist Şerife Gönüllü.*

I always imagined a virtual assistant just like my virtual version. 
I wanted to make this dream come true after exploring Python libraries.
I called my virtual assistant as Zinku, I've inspired by my surname because my surname means Zinc in Turkish. :heart_eyes:

Zinku can understand your voice and commands, talk with you, search something on wikipedia, tell your currently played songs on spotify, open a video on youtube, make jokes to make you happy, tell you today's date. :sparkles:

### Screenshots

* Don't forget to say hello to Zinku!

* You can ask anything with beginning **"Who is?"** or **"What is?"**, it will say first information on wikipedia.
